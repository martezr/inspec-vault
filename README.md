# HashiCorp Vault - InSpec Profile

## Description

This [InSpec](https://github.com/chef/inspec) compliance profile checks security best practices for the HashiCorp Vault server

InSpec is an open-source run-time framework and rule language used to specify compliance, security, and policy requirements for testing any node in your infrastructure.

## Requirements

* at least [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) version 1.38.8
* [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/downloads.html)

## Resources

### `vault_command`

Use the `vault_command()` InSpec custom resource in your own InSpec profiles to test objects in your Vault server via the CLI (requires the `vault` cli available in your `PATH` where you run `inspec`). If the command stdout can be parsed as JSON (specify `-format=json` in your vault command), then any top-level JSON keys can be accessed as attributes of the resource.

See [`test/vault-command/`](test/vault-command/) for an example InSpec profile using the `vault_command()` custom resource from this profile as a dependency. Or, follow the example below.

#### Example

First, add this profile as a dependency in your profile's inspec.yml

```yaml
name: my-vault-profile
version: 0.1.0
depends:
- name: inspec-vault
  # see https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/#git for available config
  git: https://github.com/martezr/inspec-vault
  branch:  master
```

Then add your controls in your profile's `controls/` directory using the `vault_command()` custom resource from this profile you now depend on.

```ruby
control 'vault_resources' do
  # VAULT_ADDR and VAULT_TOKEN env vars should first be exported
  describe vault_command('status') do
    its('stdout') { should match(/^Sealed\s+false\s*$/) }
    its('stdout') { should match(/^Version\s+0\.11\.\d+\s*$/) }
    its('stdout') { should match(/^Cluster Name\s+vault-cluster-\w+\s*$/) }
    # json is the stdout parsed as JSON. if stdout could not be parsed as JSON, json is nil
    its('json') { should be_nil }
    its('stderr') { should cmp '' }
  end

  # If the output can be parsed as JSON, the top level keys of the JSON response are available
  describe vault_command('status -format=json') do
    its('sealed') { should cmp false }
    its('version') { should match(/0\.11\.\d+/) }
    its('cluster_name') { should match(/vault-cluster-\w+/) }
    its('stderr') { should cmp '' }
  end

  # If VAULT_ADDR and VAULT_TOKEN env vars are not set, they can be specified in vault_command()
  describe vault_command('secrets list -format=json', vault_addr: 'http://localhost:8200', vault_token: 'root-token') do
    its('secret/') { should include('type' => 'kv', 'options' => { 'version' => '2' }) }
    # json is the stdout parsed as JSON. if stdout could not be parsed as JSON, json is nil
    its('json') { should_not include('bad-secret-path/')}
    its('stderr') { should cmp '' }
  end
end
```

Test out your profile

```shell
# navigate to your inspec profile
cd my-vault-profile

# specify vault address and token via env vars (or in the controls code shown above)
export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200 VAULT_TOKEN=root-token

# run a dev vault server in the background
vault server -dev "-dev-root-token-id=${VAULT_TOKEN}" &

# run your inspec profile!
inspec exec .

#  Vault Command: 'status'
#     ✔  stdout should match /^Sealed\s+false\s*$/
#     ✔  stdout should match /^Version\s+0\.11\.\d+\s*$/
#     ✔  stdout should match /^Cluster Name\s+vault-cluster-\w+\s*$/
#     ✔  stderr should cmp == ""
#  Vault Command: 'status -format=json'
#     ✔  sealed should cmp == false
#     ✔  version should match /0\.11\.\d+/
#     ✔  cluster_name should match /vault-cluster-\w+/
#     ✔  stderr should cmp == ""
#  Vault Command: 'secrets list -format=json'
#     ✔  secret/ should include {"type" => "kv", "options" => {"version" => "2"}}
#     ✔  stderr should cmp == ""

# after your tests you can kill the vault server you sent to the background
pkill vault
```

### Platform

- CentOS 7

## Attributes

We use a yml attribute file to steer the configuration, the following options are available:

  * `vault_user: vault`
    define trusted user to run the Vault service
  * `vault_service: vault`
    The name of the vault service
  * `vault_service_path: /etc/systemd/system/vault.service`
    The path on the system where the Vault service configuration file is located
  * `vault_dir: /opt/vault`
    The system path for the vault installation
  * `vault_user: vault`
    The system user account that the vault service runs as
  * `vault_tlscert: /opt/vault/ssl/server_cert.pem`
    Path to TLS certificate file
  * `vault_tlskey: /opt/vaul/ssl/server_key.pem`
    Path to TLS key file

## Usage

InSpec makes it easy to run your tests wherever you need. More options listed here: [InSpec cli](http://inspec.io/docs/reference/cli/)

```
# run profile locally
$ git clone https://github.com/martezr/inspec-vault
$ inspec exec inspec-vault

# run profile locally and directly from Github
$ inspec exec https://github.com/martezr/inspec-vault
```
